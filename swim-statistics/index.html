            <h1>Swimming Race Correlation Statistics</h1>
            <p>I was curious about which swim events were the most closely correlated after some teammates and I had a debate about 
                the weirdest specialty combo (I thought it was sprint free and 200 back). So I scraped some data from Swimcloud and 
                ran the numbers. I pulled my numbers from the top ranked male swimmers in the class of 2025 on Swimcloud, and ended 
                up with a sample size of n=1063. I then categorized these swimmers by their best event, and counted the number of 
                occurances of an event in their 2nd-4th best events. Divide this by the total number of swimmers with that best 
                event, and you have the correlations. The scripts I used to collect the data and create the correlations can be found <a href="https://github.com/ThePotato10/swim-statistic/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The most surprising data I found was 100 back/100 breast, which has no overlap at all, despite both of those being sprint 
                events. Also, there's not a single top ranked swimmer who's good at both sprint and distance free, which I found 
                surprising, because I figured at least one swimmer would be something of an all purpose freestyler.
            </p>
            <p>To answer the question, though, the weirdest specialty combo that does exist is the 100 breast best event + 1000 free as another good event. These are not 
                only the two most different styles of swimming, but one is a complete sprint and the other is pure distance, making this
                a really strange combination. Only one swimmer had this combo, and I think he, whoever he is, deserves the crown for 
                weirdest specialty combo in swimming
            </p>
