Any doubts about what you’re doing only get worse as you realize the absurdities of what you’re doing. Storytelling means inventing a whole new world, and so realizing that you’re doing so prevents you from being immersed in the world you’re making. </p>
<p>At least, some jumble of thoughts like that was buzzing through Ezra Thorne’s head as he sat down on the patio outside Kate Ross’s house. He could still hear the noise from the party behind him, the shitty pop music and the chatter and laughter. He was thinking about his own story. The one he told, whether he tried to or not, was a variation on the classic story of high school success. He was smart, but didn’t work too hard. He was athletic and annoyingly popular. His girlfriend, you know the type. He spent his weekends partying with the same group of kids, all of whom were destined for the same good-enough state colleges and were extremely confident in the futures they had planned for them.</p>
<p>Ezra looked out over Kate’s backyard. She lived in one of the huge historic houses that backed up against the river. Over the manicured lawns and professionally maintained gardens, he could see the moonlight’s glint on the river. It was one of the last weekends in May, and he would be graduating high school soon. It had been hot earlier, but the darkness was cooling everything down. The wind softly blew, rustling the trees that lined the edge of the property. Ezra tugged at the collar of his shirt, aware of the alcohol fogging his head. As per usual, the night was much softer out here. There were kids smoking some weed, a few couples looking for a quiet place, and some drunk guys playing a terrible game of football, their shouts and noise faintly muted in the stillness of the moment. Ezra laid back on the patio stones and looked at the sky above him. The light pollution from their suburb was terrible, and it was nights like this when Ezra remembered his bucket list mission to get out to someplace beautiful and see the night sky, far away from everyone else. </p>
<p>Lost in his own indecipherable thoughts, he realized that someone had sat down next to him. </p>
<p>“Mind the company?”</p>
<p>Ezra recognized the voice, but he couldn’t place it. He sat up and looked over at the girl sitting next to him. Instantly, he recognized her.</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>Sadie Hunt sat down next to him. He hadn’t talked to her since sophomore year at least. They had grown up on the same street, but her family moved to a different neighborhood around the start of high school and they had fallen out of touch. They ran in the same social circles, but they weren’t friends. At least, not anymore. </p>
<p>They sat in silence for a minute, maybe a beat too long. She looked out over the backyard with him, shivering slightly. She pushed her hair back behind her ear. Ezra almost didn’t recognize her, and she definitely wasn’t the girl he remembered. She looked at him and smiled softly, and the moonlight caught her eyes.</p>
<p>“So what are you doing out here?” she finally murmured, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>“There’s something romantic about being out here right now,” Ezra said, after thinking for a second. “Not in the classical way. It just feels romantically timeless to be a little drunk and thinking about life and sitting out here on a beautiful night.”</p>
<p>Sadie nodded and thought about what he said.</p>
<p>“Where’s Emma? I thought you guys were dating.”</p>
<p>Ezra looked down the yard to the river again and she continued, “I mean, wouldn’t it be more romantic with her?”</p>
<p>Ezra looked at his feet, and then said, “She’s mad at me. Or maybe I’m mad at her. I really don’t know any more.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s not my place, but you guys never seemed right for each other,” Sadie broke the silence after another few moments. She shivered again, and leaned in towards Ezra. “Is that why you’re out here?”</p>
<p>“Kind of? I know she’s drunk as hell in there, and probably flirting with someone to make me jealous.” Ezra paused. “I know her games too well.”</p>
<p>Another quiet minute passed.</p>
<p>“At least it’s a beautiful night.”</p>
<p>Ezra nodded, and they sat and watched the world for a few moments longer. Sadie absently drummed the pavement between them. Finally, he said,</p>
<p>“Sadie, do you think we get to tell our own stories?”</p>
<p>“Shit, I’m too drunk for that,” she said, lightly laughing. “But isn’t that the same question as the whole ‘free-will’ debate? Like, do we have agency in our lives?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s a dumb fucking debate. Of course we have free will. The two drunk idiots wrestling over there are proving that right now. I mean, like, is the narrative arc of my life already set?” Ezra took a breath, and then continued, his pace picking up. “Like, I can already see my future. College, job, career, marriage, house in the suburbs. It’s a story that’s been told a thousand times before.”</p>
<p>Sadie exhaled slowly, and Ezra continued, talking more to himself now. “I know I can do something different with my life, but I also know I won’t. I’m too afraid. I think my future is predetermined by my own self.” He paused. “Do I sound insane right now?” Ezra whispered to no one in particular.</p>
<p>Sadie laced her fingers in his. Their conversation was slow. It hung in the almost summer air, creating a private world for them. Soft silence was a third participant, filling the gaps between them.</p>
<p>“I think I know what you mean. The details are for us, but the plot isn’t.”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>Sadie took another deep breath and exhaled. The night was growing stiller and quieter as people started to go home. She spoke slowly and quietly, almost whispering every word, like she was trying to herd metaphorical cats in her sentences.</p>
<p>“I think we just don’t believe in any of the other possible stories we could tell about ourselves. Shit, Ezra, our stories are easy to tell. To do anything else is unbearably bold.”</p>
<p>“That’s fucking tragic.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But isn’t it romantic? We’re too small to do anything but fill in the details, so we might as well find all the pretty moments we can.”</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, Ezra looked over at Sadie. For the first time in an even longer while, he saw the girl he knew in eighth grade. He remembered their class camping trip at the end of the school year, and how they sat on the dock at the lake, just like they were now. He remembered thinking he was in love with her, in the childish way, where love is more abstract than real. He remembered her pushing him away when he tried to kiss her, and both of their jumbled and rushed explanations of what had just happened. He remembered her moving away before they ever had a chance to talk again.</p>
<p>She was gorgeous. Undeniably. Her eyes sparkled in the starlight and she rested her head on Ezra’s shoulder. The stillness of the night was complete at this point. Maybe there were a few remnants of the party inside, but they were the only ones out here now.</p>
<p>Ezra thought about the stories he couldn’t make himself believe. He imagined himself as an author, or living in some historic European city. But that wasn’t the life he had laid out for him, and so thus they would remain, mere stories that echoed what was possible in his mind. Maybe someone more bold than him or more imaginative than him could convince himself those stories were true. Maybe he would one day, Ezra thought with a pitying smile.</p>
<p>“Sadie?”</p>
<p>She looked up at him.</p>
<p>“This is one of those pretty moments.”</p>
<p>She smiled and looked out over the dark river.</p>
<p>“It really is, Ezra.”</p></div>
