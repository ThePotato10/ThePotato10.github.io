It posts what I think of as pro-humanity content. It's a bunch of compilations of short videos of humans and our pets doing goofy and beautiful things. It's the kind of stuff that doesn't even make sense when you can't see the videos. Stuff like someone dive tackling someone else off a paddle board. Or a whole bleacher stand cheering for a toddler landing a bottle flip. Or a police officer throwing it back during a traffic stop. Or two guys dapping each other up while hitting snowboard tricks. All of it set to 2010s white girl pop music. Katy Perry, OneRepublic, Kesha, Owl City, all the classics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I mean this completely seriously, it's art. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I believe humans are by nature good. That's a nebulous concept, but I think we are meant to care for each other, support each other, and try to make each other laugh. It's trite to say that humans are social creatures, but we really are. Not in the pack-animal sense, but in the sense that we are built for connection and wonder and love. This account is the antithesis of social media.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the tech industry built social media, they promised to connect the world and build a global community. They've achieved the opposite. When I open up any social media app, I'm almost instantly hit with a flood of bad news or an endless feed of posts designed to keep me mindlessly scrolling. Never do I feel any kind of connection to anyone else. Not once. I consider myself generally optimistic about technology, but I've come to believe that social media is the most dangerous innovation since at least leaded gasoline. Strong words, maybe, but around me I see a generation that is terrified and wholly unable to look up from their phones. I don't think its hyperbolic to say that social media has done untold societal damage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I feel stuck online sometimes. Everyone has to be online, whether they want to or not. I have a teacher this year who didn't give out a single paper assignment. Whether we like it or not, the internet, and all its rot, is kinda inescapable for most of us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, in @retiredsuicidebomber, I see a glimmer of what social media and the internet could've and should've been. It's an account that is unapologetically pro-humanity. It showcases us at our best and happiest, or at least in the best light possible. In its short video mashups, I see laughter and the beauty of humanity. I feel more hopeful after I see their posts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even their handle is a reference to this. Suicide bombers don't retire. By calling themselves a 'retired' suicide bomber, they're subtly referencing that they couldn't go through with their mission of destruction and instead decided to become a chronicle for the goodness of humanity. In an increasingly toxic online landscape, we need more hope and reminders of what it truly means to be human. We don't need more political 'leaders' throwing senseless barbs at each other. I don't give a shit if the guy biking down the street with his dog on his shoulders is a anarchist, Republican, or communist. I just know that he did something goofy and beautiful, and we could all use a little more of that in our world. </p></div>
