I sent her one of the things I wrote here, but I don't know if she thought to or knew how to check the rest of the site. I don't know if I want her to find this. I think I just have to write.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am so in love with her. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Those words don't do what I feel justice. Not even a little. An arrangement of pixels on a screen or lines on a page could never capture the feelings I have for her. It's like trying to build a cage for the wind. She is so beautiful it physically hurts in my chest to look at her. No one else makes me feel like she does. I don't think anyone even could make me feel the way she does. She enchants me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've been in love before. Not like this. It's never been all I think about, even when I said it was. I'm sorry I lied to you Isabel. I really thought I meant it, but I had no idea how strongly I could love someone. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I know she loves me, but not like I love her. She doesn't realize that. Lucky for her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I know we have to break up. I can't avoid it. Maybe it's my fault or maybe it's hers, but we just don't think about relationships the same way. Our one recurring fight is that she's too busy and doesn't prioritize me. I mean, when she doesn't even bother to respond to a "good morning ❤️" text, I don't think I'm wrong for feeling a little jilted. Not the point. I think 'fault' is the wrong framework for even thinking about this. It's just who I am and who she is, but distance was never in the cards for us. it is a fact that we are breaking up on August 8, 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have to try to be friends with her. I promised her I would. But I don't think I can. I can't imagine talking to her and not being hopelessly in love with her. I've been in love with her for 7 years, ever since I knew what it meant to be in love with someone. Even when I was dating other girls I was in love with her. We both work together at the same pool we hung out at as kids. Two summers ago, I was dating someone else. All the same, I remember cleaning the floors one night with her and she sprayed me with the hose like as a joke. I reached over to knock it away and grabbed her wrist and I remember thinking, maybe just for a moment, how cosmically, brutally unfair it was that I couldn't kiss her right there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>She's the only girl capable of breaking my heart. It's only a matter of time before she does.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I truly believe she was born with a piece of my soul. I can't find any other way to explain how I feel. I am drawn to her. She is a firefly to my soul. She confuses me endlessly, but nothing else makes sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I read once that everyone experiences a great tragedy in their life, entirely personal to them. Maybe I'm fortunate then. My great tragedy is that I have found the girl I want to marry, someone who is inexplicably perfect for me, and it can never and will never work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's not even a case of 'right person, wrong time', but more like a case of 'right person, wrong people'. I hope I've accepted that. I know it but I don't know if I believe it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope she remembers me the same way I'll remember her. I am so so so unbelievably lucky that I get the privilege of having loved and lost her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I love you Kansiri.</p></div>
