<p></p>
<p>I don't know why I'm publishing my thoughts for anyone with internet access to see instead of just writing them down and hiding them somewhere. I think I want her to look for this and know how deeply I care. More than that, if she finds this, it'll mean she cares too. She's the only other person who knows this exists, and I think she's forgotten about it by now. If she cared enough to remember this exists and to check it then she deserves to know how I'm feeling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Who am I kidding. She's never gonna look and the only thing this will do is embarrass me later. The girl who didn't care enough to text her boyfriend of a year is definitely not gonna be digging through the depths of the internet for the sake of her ex.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet I'm writing this anyway. As much as I want to pretend otherwise, I'm not over her. I knew we were going to break up, but it didn't have to be like this. It didn't have to be because she tried to ghost me. The truth is, at some point she stopped being invested. She was always a bad girlfriend, but there was a difference before. It's not worth thinking about anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want an apology I'm never going to get, but more than that, I want to tell her that I miss her more than I ever thought possible and I would take her back in a heartbeat if I had any reason to believe that she was as invested as I was. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe in a few weeks or a few years I'll take these down, but for now I'm waiting and hoping for an epilogue that won't be written</p></div>
