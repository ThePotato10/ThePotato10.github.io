            <p><b>The Window</b> is a algorithmically generated work of art. Each pattern has a roughly 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance of appearing. In other words, by clicking on that button, you're shown a pattern that no one else in the universe will ever see. This is an artistic experiment designed to provoke thought about the relationship we as a species have with art. This piece was not made by AI, but is fully created by a machine upon each press of the button. Does that make the machine the artist, or is the artist the programmer behind the machine? If the point of art is to communicate emotion to the viewer, what kind of emotion can a machine communicate to a human? <em>Can</em> a machine communicate emotion in the traditional sense? Does who the artist is play a role in how we understand the emotions of the art? If a programmer or machine can create artificially extremely rare art with relative ease, how does that affect the inherent value in the rareness of art? The Window only asks questions, it doesn't answer them.</p>
