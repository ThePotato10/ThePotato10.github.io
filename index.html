            <p class='intro'>Hi! My name's JD, and two of my hobbies are web development and photography. 
                And so, I built this website to demonstrate my skills. While this page isn't interactive, 
                I'm familiar with JavaScript and React.js, so don't worry about having boring, static webpages.
                I'm also going to use this as a platform to show off my photos. My favorites are on the right. 
                Anyway, if you have any web development needs or want to use my photos for something, contact me!
                I'd love to hear from you. My email address is jd@cannonwebdev.com
            </p>
            <p class='credit'> No Wix. I wrote my own source code. You might be wondering why you'd choose the harder
                route, but the answer is simple. Building your own website makes the design more flexible, means the 
                finished product is lighter, it's easier to maintain, and it's easier to work with JavaScript or 
                another language. also, it looks more professonal and is really satisfying to work on.
