    <h1>Jaden's Law</h1>
    <p>Jaden's law describes an observed phenomenon in online chats where, despite the original topic, as the conversation evolves, the chance of the topic becoming sexual increases logarithmically to the length of the conversation. While every online chat experiences some form of this effect, it's most pronounced in real time chats where the participants are friendly.</p>
    <b>As the length of an online conversation between friends approaches infinity, the chance of the topic becoming sexual approaches p=1</b>
