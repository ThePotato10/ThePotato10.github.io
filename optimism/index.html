        <h1>Why I'm Optimistic</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><em>People are good. </em>I believe people are fundamentally good, rather than fundamentally evil. Every politician and CEO seems dead-set on proving me wrong, but, as humans, we care about the people we love. I have family and friends that I love, and I know love me. People hold the door, donate to causes they believe in, and do nice things for each other. A bunch of degens on Reddit who spend their Fridays and Saturdays talking trash about college football raised $34000 for Toys for Tots. Every person I know personally is a good person, even if I don't personally like them. They have dreams and they have people they love too. We're all in this together, and I'm glad we are.</li>
            <li><em>I am good. </em>I am a person with agency and power in my life, and with that, I can do good in the world. Even if I don't have the power or influence that other people might, the things I do affect other people and especially the people I care about. On an individual scale, this seems insignificant, but I believe in the ripple effect of goodness. Being kind to someone puts out an energy that is good for us all. I'm optimistic because I, as just one person, have the power to change lives for the better, if only in a small way.</li>
            <li><em>Life is good. </em>First, the obvious fact that life, especially in a developed western nation, is extremely materially good. The average American lives a life of unfathomable luxury to the royals of 200 years ago. More than that, however, humans are privileged enough to get to fall in love, experience heartbreak, feel the sun on our skin, dance, go to concerts and do so so many other things that make life good. It's all a goddamn amazing beautiful adventure that I feel so so lucky to be able to enjoy.</li>
            <li><em>I have no other choice. </em>Pessimism is a killing ideology that thrives on extinguishing hope. To be pessimistic is to give up on the promise of a better tomorrow, and I refuse to let myself do that. It's really easy to only see the bad in the world, especially when we have a whole news and social media ecosystem that thrives on anger. Despite that, the good is there when you make the effort to look for it. Pessimism is easy and optimism is hard, but that doesn't mean that we should ever give up hope. The alternative is to doomscroll and pontificate on a scary world while doing nothing to help, and we as humans are better than that. To be optimistic is to fight to create a better tomorrow for humanity, because we know that we owe it to each other. Optimism is the struggle of being hopeful for a better future, and though it can be a struggle, it is an endlessly rewarding one. I will never give up hope for a better future.</li>
