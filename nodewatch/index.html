                <p>It's no secret that Nodejs apps have a lot of dependencies. In fact, the size of the node_modules folder has become a meme. However, I've met far too many programmers who claim their app is lightweight, having "only 4 dependencies in the package.json". The thing is, each of those dependencies has possibly dozens of dependencies of their own, and their dependencies might have dependencies, and so on. In fact, Express, one of the most popular NPM packages, has 56 dependencies, including itself</p>

                <p class='emphasis'>NodeWatch easily integrates into existing DevOps or Deploy pipelines to provide insight into how many unique pieces of software your app depends on</p>

                <p style='text-align: center;'>Once you install NodeWatch, all you need to do is type the command <code>nodewatch</code> to reveal your dependencies</p>
